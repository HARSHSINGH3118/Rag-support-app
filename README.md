# 🤖 RAG Customer Support Assistant

Welcome to the **RAG Customer Support Assistant**, an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built to streamline customer support interactions. It combines semantic retrieval, sentiment-aware response generation, escalation detection, and customer satisfaction (CSAT) tracking in a single unified app.

## 💡 Summary of Approach
- The user query is semantically embedded and matched against a vector store (ChromaDB) to retrieve top-k relevant document chunks.

- The retrieved context and detected sentiment are fed into a custom response generator to generate empathetic, context-aware replies.

- Sentiment is evaluated using pretrained models and trigger keywords are matched for escalation detection.

- Alerts are logged to file and optionally emailed to a designated support address.

- CSAT feedback is collected and saved for post-session review.

## 🤔 Assumptions Made
- The support documents are available in .txt format and stored in a local folder.

- Gmail SMTP is used for email alerts; app password is pre-configured via .env.

- CSAT is binary (Yes/No) for simplicity.

- The system assumes a single-agent session and does not persist per-user logs.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy Notes
- .env is listed in .gitignore to protect secrets

- Email alerts use secure SSL with Gmail SMTP (port 465)

- Data is stored locally in CSV logs and ChromaDB

- No user PII is collected or transmitted externally
