Orders can be canceled within 12 hours of placement, as long as they havenâ€™t been shipped. To cancel an order:
1. Log into your account.
2. Navigate to 'My Orders'.
3. Select the order and click 'Cancel'.
If the cancel option is unavailable, the order may already be in transit. In such cases, you can request a return after delivery.
